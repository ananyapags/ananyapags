 🤠  Howdy! My name is Ananya, and I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at SCU. 

 😍  My passion for computer science stems from my obsession with brain teasers and puzzles. I'm addicted to the feeling you get when you finally figure out a solution, similar to the one where your code successfully runs! 

 🔭  This past year, I've been working with Algorithm efficiency and AI, and although I love it, I can't wait to explore other areas of CS. 

 🌱  I’m currently learning more about cloud, specifically Firebase and AWS!

 ⚡  In my free time, I enjoy gardening, running, and watching horror movies with friends. 

 👯‍♀️ Feel free to reach out if you want to be friends, work together, or simply have any questions.
