## ü§†  Howdy! My name is Ananya, and I'm a Senior studying Computer Science. Currently looking for 2024 internship opportunities!

 üòç  My passion for computer science stems from my obsession with brain teasers and puzzles. I'm addicted to the feeling you get when you finally figure out a solution, similar to the one where your code successfully runs! 

 üî≠  This past year, I've been working with Machine Learning and WebDev, and I love it! I also can't wait to explore other areas of CS. 

 üå±  I‚Äôm currently learning more about cloud, specifically Firebase and AWS!

 ‚ö°  In my free time, I enjoy gardening, running, and watching horror movies with friends. 

 üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to continue learning and empowering the community around me. Whether you want to just say hi or work with me on a project feel free to reach out! Look forward to hearing from you!
